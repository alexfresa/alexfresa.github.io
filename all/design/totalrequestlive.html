                <h1>Total Request Live</h1>
                <p>"'Total Request Live' uproots a large portion of my childhood by calling upon some of my earliest exposure with contemporary and mainstream music, the overt sexualization of the female figure, and a casted influence through polarizing class systems. The masculine elements within the piece (such as the steel body) and natural elements (fire, lightning, and the shadowed female hosts) work to portray the invisible but limitless power structures that lie outside of our control, which hang over the TRL audience both inside and outside of the studio environment. The message ultimately speaks of both physical and mental restriction and the urge to feel liberated even though it lies outside one's reach. The piece is loosely based off of Mariah Carey’s “Heartbreaker”, a video residing within TRL’s infamous retirement home, as well as Mariah’s controversial appearance on the show on July 19, 2001."</p>
