                <h1>Onus</h1>
                <p>A collaborative art and design magazine published as an interactive .pdf in May 2018. </br>The project consists of self-created work as well as select submissions by a number of emerging artists and writers.
                </br>
                </br>Introspection, growth, darkness, satire, escapism, and the occult were a few common themes explored through submissions, though the only requirement was to "explore an authentic individual perspective that emotionally resonates with the artist."
                </br>
                </br>Additionally, the publication is unified through a loosely depicted narrative that progresses throughout its duration. This features words and imagery that illustrate the paradoxes and fascination with an individual's detached reality.
