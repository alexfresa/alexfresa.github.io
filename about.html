        <div class="statement"><p>Alex Fresa is a multimedia artist and designer based in North Carolina. 
        </bR>
        </bR>He is currently finishing his last semester at the University of North Carolina in Asheville while studying for his B.A. in new media and studio art with focuses in interactive design, web development, and sculpture.
        </bR>
        </bR>His interests are fueled by personal cultural perceptions, emotional memory, marginalized struggles, and societal taboos. He is particularly interested in exploring the ways these factors may be re-interpreted through contemporary media. 
        </bR>
        </bR>His work is heavily influenced by his surroundings and often pulls inspiration from subjects such as black comedy, introspective literature, electronic music, clinical psychology, juxtaposition, horror cinema, video games, the adolescent, and LGBTQ culture.
        </bR>
        </bR>By incorporating these skills with his experience in video production and sound design, he strives to explore the ways in which cultural interfaces and other new media devices impact the contemporary world and how they relate to the human condition.
